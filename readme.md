### Example

The following replicates the above worker graph. See [here](./doc/example.js) for a JavaScript version.

```typescript
// app.ts

import { spawn, Main, Thread, channel, Sender, Receiver } from '@sinclair/threadbox'

@Thread() class WorkerC {
    run() {
        return Math.random()
    }
}
@Thread() class WorkerB {
    async run(sender: Sender) {
        const c_0 = spawn(WorkerC)
        const c_1 = spawn(WorkerC)
        const c_2 = spawn(WorkerC)
        const c_3 = spawn(WorkerC)
        const [a, b, c, d] = await Promise.all([
            c_0.run(),
            c_1.run(),
            c_2.run(),
            c_3.run(),
        ])
        await sender.send([a, b, c, d])
        await sender.end()
        await c_0.dispose()
        await c_1.dispose()
        await c_2.dispose()
        await c_3.dispose()
    }
}
@Thread() class WorkerA {
    async run(receiver: Receiver) {
        for await(const [a, b, c, d] of receiver) { }
    }
}
// start here ...
@Main() default class {
    async main() {
        const [sender, receiver] = channel()
        const a = spawn(WorkerA)
        const b = spawn(WorkerB)
        await Promise.all([
            a.run(receiver),
            b.run(sender) 
        ])
        await a.dispose()
        await b.dispose()
    }
}
```

## Overview

ThreadBox is a threading library for JavaScript that is built upon NodeJS `worker_threads`. It is written to allow for compute intensive JavaScript and WASM to be trivially distributed across many threads by wrapping heavy calls within a plain JavaScript class. ThreadBox can take any JavaScript class and move it to a worker thread. It provides to the caller an asynchronous interface in which to invoke methods of the class across thread boundaries, and provides clean worker thread disposal.

ThreadBox uses a recursive pattern to spawn worker threads. ThreadBox will recursively call into the applications entry module (typically `app.js`) and instance the requested `@Thread()` class. Because each new worker is spawned from the same entry module as the application, `class`, `function` and `const` definitions defined by the application are also available to each subsequent thread. This recursive approach allows for ergonomic same file threading without needing to split related worker logic into seperate `.js` files while still retaining the ability to naturally split classes and functions across multiple modules.

ThreadBox was built as a research project and is primarily geared towards TypeScript development. It does however provide a non-decorator based fallback API for JavaScript users. This library is offered as is to anyone who may find it of use.

Built with Node 12.16.1 LTS and TypeScript 3.8.3.

<a name="Main"></a>

## Main

The `@Main()` decorator denotes a class as the programs entry point. The classes `main(argv)` function will be called automatically when the application is started. 

```typescript
import { Main } from '@sinclair/threadbox'

@Main() default class {
    main(argv: string[]) {
        console.log(argv)
    }
}

// JavaScript users can use __Main(Program) if
// decorators are not available.
```
Because ThreadBox spawns worker threads recursively, the `@Main()` class will executed only in the main thread. The `@Main` decorator abstracts the following.

```typescript
import { isMainThread } from `worker_thread`

if(isMainThread) { 
    /* main thread */
} else {
    /* worker thread  */
}
```

<a name="Thread"></a>

## Thread

The `@Thread()` decorator marks a class as threadable and allows it to be spawned as a worker thread. When spawned, the host thread will be able to execute any function available on the class. The class may additionally implement an optional `dispose()` function that will be invoked when the host thread terminates the worker.

```typescript
import { Thread } from '@sinclair/threadbox'

@Thread() class Worker {
    add(a: number, b: number) {
        return a + b
    }
    dispose() { 
        console.log('disposed!')
    }
}
@Main() default class {
    async main() {
        const worker = spawn(Worker)
        const result = await worker.add(10, 20)
        await worker.dispose()
    }
}
// JavaScript users can use __Thread(Worker) if
// decorators are not available.
```

All JavaScript classes can be decorated with `@Thread()`.

<a name="Spawn"></a>

## Spawn

The `spawn()` function spawns a new worker thread and returns a handle to the class being spawned. The `spawn()` function may also accept parameters if the class constructor takes arguments.

```typescript
import { spawn, Main, Worker } from '@sinclair/threadbox'

@Thread() class Worker {
    constructor(private message: string) {
        console.log('worker: constructor', message)
    }
    method() {
        console.log('worker: method')
    }
    dispose() {
        console.log('worker: dispose')
    }
}
@Main() default class {
    async main() {
        const worker = spawn(Worker, 'hello world')
        await worker.method()
        await worker.dispose() // important!
    }
}
```
The return type of the `spawn()` function is a `ThreadInterface` object. This `ThreadInterface` is a promisfied version of the class interface. The `ThreadInterface` also provides an additional `dispose()` function that is available irrespective of if the class has provided an implementation. Calling `dispose()` on the `ThreadInterface` will result in the worker being terminated.

<a name="Channel"></a>

## Channel

ThreadBox provides a channel API that is built upon the [MessageChannel](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MessageChannel) API. ThreadBox channels implement a synchronization protocol that enables a `Sender` to optionally `await` for messages to be received by a `Receiver`. ThreadBox channels are loosely modelled on Rust mpsc [channels](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/mpsc/fn.channel.html). 

```typescript
import { channel } from '@sinclair/threadbox'

const [sender, receiver] = channel()
```

The channel `Sender` and `Receiver` types can be used to stream sequences of values between cooperating threads. The `Sender` will async buffer values if the caller does not `await` on `send()`. The `Receiver` type implements `[Symbol.asyncIterator]` so can be used with `for-await-of`.

#### Example 1

The following creates a channel inside the `Main` thread and sends the `Sender` to the worker thread. The worker thread will emit values to the `Sender` which are iterated on within the `Main` thread.

```typescript
import { spawn, Main, Worker, channel, Sender, Receiver } from '@sinclair/threadbox'

@Thread() class Worker {
    async execute(sender: Sender<number>) {
        await sender.send(1)
        await sender.send(2)
        await sender.send(3)
        await sender.end() // EOF
    }
}

@Main() default class {
    main() {
        // spawn worker
        const worker = spawn(Worker)
        // create channel
        const [sender, receiver] = channel<number>()
        // pass sender to worker
        worker.execute(sender)
        // iterate receiver
        for await(const value of receiver) {
            console.log('recv', value)
        }
        // dispose
        await worker.dispose()
    }
}
```

#### Example 2

The following creates a channel inside the worker thread and returns a `Receiver` on its `stream()` function. The `Main` thread then spawns the worker thread and calls `stream()` and awaits for the `Receiver`. It then iterates on the `Receiver`. The `into()` function is a util function that allows one to move into an async context.

```typescript
import { spawn, into, Main, Worker, channel, Sender, Receiver } from '@sinclair/threadbox'

@Thread() class Worker {
    stream(): Receiver<number> {
        const [sender, receiver] = channel<number>()
        into(async() => {
            await sender.send(1)
            await sender.send(2)
            await sender.send(3)
            await sender.end()
        }).then(() => { /* done */ })
        return receiver
    }
}

@Main() default class {
    main() {
        // Spawn new Worker thread
        const worker = spawn(Worker)
        // await receiver
        const receiver = await worker.stream()
        // iterate receiver
        for await(const value of receiver) {
            console.log('recv', value)
        }
        // dispose
        await worker.dispose()
    }
}
```

<a name="Marshal"></a>

## Marshal

The `@Marshal()` decorator marks a class as marshalled. This enables instances of the class to be sent and reconstructed across thread boundaries. ThreadBox will automatically marshal all classes marked with `@Marshal()` across thread function calls, as well as across channels.

This functionality allows class instances to be transferred to remote threads for remote invocation.

```typescript

import { spawn, Main, Thread, Marshal } from '@sinclair/threadbox'

// Instances of this class can be sent between threads.
@Marshal() class Transferrable {
    method() {
        console.log('hello world !!!')
    }
}
@Thread() class Worker {
    // instance sent from host thread.
    execute(instance: Transferrable) {
        instance.method() // callable
    }
}
@Main() default class {
    async main() {
        // spawn worker
        const worker = spawn(Worker)
        // create instance
        const instance = new Transferrable()
        // send instance to worker to execute.
        await worker.execute(instance)
        // dispose.
        await worker.dispose()
    }
}

// JavaScript users can use __Marshal(Foo) if
// decorators are not available.
```
Marshalling class instances isn't free and is generally slower than passing plain JS objects. Use only when you need to move runtime logic between threads.

<a name="Mutex"></a>

## Mutex

ThreadBox provides a `Mutex` primitive that is built upon JavaScript [Atomics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Atomics). It is used to enter into critical sections of code.

```typescript
import { Mutex } from '@sinclair/threadbox'

const mutex = new Mutex()

const lock = mutex.lock()

// critical section

lock.dispose()
```

The example below spawns 4 instances of the `Worker` class. A `Mutex` instance is passed into each worker where by the worker takes a `MutexLock` on the `execute()` method. The worker thread holds onto their respective lock for 1 second before releasing. Only 1 of the 4 workers will execute the critical section (below) at one time. The timeout is used to demonstrate the locking behavior.

```typescript
import { spawn, Main, Thread, Mutex } from '@sinclair/threadbox'

@Thread() class Worker {
    execute(mutex: Mutex) {
        const lock = mutex.lock()
        //
        // critical section !!
        //
        setTimeout(() => lock.dispose(), 1000)
    }
}
@Main() default class {
    async main() {
        const worker_0 = spawn(Worker)
        const worker_1 = spawn(Worker)
        const worker_2 = spawn(Worker)
        const worker_3 = spawn(Worker)

        const mutex  = new Mutex()
        await Promise.all([
            worker_0.execute(mutex),
            worker_1.execute(mutex),
            worker_2.execute(mutex),
            worker_3.execute(mutex)
        ]) // .. 4 seconds approx

        await worker_0.dispose()
        await worker_1.dispose()
        await worker_2.dispose()
        await worker_3.dispose()
    }
}
```

<a name="SharedArrayBuffer"></a>

## SharedArrayBuffer

The following demonstrates using `SharedArrayBuffer` to parallelize operations performed across a shared `Float32Array`. The shared buffer is sent to 4 workers with an index to store the result.

```typescript
import { spawn, Main, Worker } from '@sinclair/threadbox'

@Thread() class ComputeForIndex {
    execute(buffer: Float32Array, index: number) {
        // sleep 5 seconds
        const started = Date.now()
        while((Date.now() - started) < 5000) {}
        buffer[index] = Math.random()
    }
}

@Main() default class {
    async main() {
        // 4 x 32bit floats
        const shared = new SharedArrayBuffer(4 * Float32Array.BYTES_PER_ELEMENT)
        const buffer = new Float32Array(shared)

        // spin up 4 workers
        const c_0 = spawn(ComputeForIndex)
        const c_1 = spawn(ComputeForIndex)
        const c_2 = spawn(ComputeForIndex)
        const c_3 = spawn(ComputeForIndex)

        // process in parallel
        await Promise.all([
            c_0.execute(buffer, 0),
            c_1.execute(buffer, 1),
            c_2.execute(buffer, 2),
            c_3.execute(buffer, 3)
        ])

        // clean up
        await c_0.dispose()
        await c_1.dispose()
        await c_2.dispose()
        await c_3.dispose()

        // result
        console.log('result', buffer)
    }
}
```
